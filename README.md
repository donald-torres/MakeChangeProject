# MakeChangeProject

### Overview 

This is a program that simulates going to a store and dealing with a cash register(most likely a self check out). It gets user inputs for what the price of goods are.  And how much money the user gives to pay for said goods. It then gives responses based on the remaining amount or change to be returned to the user.


### Technologies / Techniques Used
 
 - Java
 - Loops
 - Conditionals 
 - Casting Data Types
 - printf() Method


### How To Run

Once running the program will request an input from the user.  Upon recieving the first input, the user will be prompted for a second input.  The program will calulate if the second input is high enough to "pay" for the first input. If more "money" is needed the user will be prompted again to input anoter number.  Once the program recieves appropriate "money" it will begin it's calculating.  The program will then return the appropriate "change" to the user and close.


### Lessons Learned

   Pros -
 -  I learned the importance of using modulus for returning values.
 -  Increased understanding of loops and if statements.
 -  When converting variable types its important to understand the decimal values 	
    otherwise you may be missing small but important values.

   Cons - 
 -  Attempted multiple methods to calculate returning values thus slowing        
    completion time.
 -  Too much idle time - For my first project I tried to do everything from memory 
    but did not utilize support.
